## cooc-only

## homo-only

## both
Observed as both homozygous and heterozygous

- Measure success by $\frac{|real \cap fake|}{|real|}$
- Is real a proper subset of naive? 
- Which ones does it pick up
- Look at LD on those that fake correctly picks up? (This would be a seperate)

This analysis can 

LD = P(A)P(B) - P(A and B)
