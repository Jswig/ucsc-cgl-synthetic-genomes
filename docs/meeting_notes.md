BRCA1
BRCA2

- model individually 

What is biologically plausible ?

- Use HG-38 reference genome 
- use frequency of each variant 
- use edit distance  
- distribution of variance depending on population 
- think about ethnicity data (data should inform the discriminator) (population frequencies) 
- pathogenicity of a variant BRCAexchange.org
    - `clinical_significance_ENAGMA` benign, likely benign, pathogenic, unknown 
- mis-sense vs non-sense vs synonymous variants 
    - *synonymous*: mutation that creates the same amino acid 
    - *mis-sense*: create different amino acide
    - *non-sense*" early STOP codon
- location of mutations:
    - functional domain or not
- cohort frequency: compare to frequency in the specific dataset
